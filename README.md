As the climate change affects our lives more and more, we have developed a portal in order to promote awareness on environmental protection.
"OurPlanet" is a React-based web application, allowing you to have the latest news related to climate change in one place. But that's not all! We also provide the user with a list of the best books and environmental activists/influencer on social media to encourage the user to care more about our beautiful planet.

## Installation

If you want to run the code locally, you have to register on the websites of the API providers, listed below, and request your own API keys. Once you have them, replace the fake values inside the file **.env.sample** with your keys and rename the file into **.env**.

After that you can open your terminal, cd into the project directory and run the command `npm install` to get all the necessary node_module files. After that, you can launch the app with the command `npm start`.
